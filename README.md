# Flask_n_Thrift
Out of the box, simple demo of Thrift communication between python Flask Backend and jQuery Frontend.

## How to run
After install dependencies in file `requirements.txt` (versions are not necessarily the same, just for reference), run command `python3 app.py` to start backend. And you can directly use `http.server` which is a http server in python to start frontend. Just run command like `python -m http.server 80 --bind localhost` in current directory. 
After above steps, you can visit the frontend and test.
